    int laptop_quantity = 1;
    int headphones_quantity = 1;
    int charger_quantity = 2;

    // Calculate subtotal for each item
    float laptop_total = laptop_price * laptop_quantity;
    float headphones_total = headphones_price * headphones_quantity;
    float charger_total = charger_price * charger_quantity;

    // Calculate the total before tax
    float subtotal = laptop_total + headphones_total + charger_total;

    // Calculate the tax (10% of subtotal)
    float tax = subtotal * 0.10;
